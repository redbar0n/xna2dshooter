Likes
- Found graphics/ artstyle pleasing
- Found the bombing mechanic realistic and rewarding
- Found the shooting mechanic solid

Dislikes/Need for improvement
- Swoop mechanic a bit loose
- Wanted more challenge (would be a matter to make enemies attack)

Other comments
- Camera positioning. Preferred the camera being centred on the plane
rather than it being stationary on the y axis.
- Even though swoop was loose, he was prepared to experiment with the mechanic.
- He would like to be able to make the plane loop if implemented into the game.
- Player actually tried to destroy all the enemies on screen. ie players would
be motivated to do so to get a high score/ upgrade the plane.
- Found the game fun. Would be prepared to play a more complete build.
